4. Maintainers can call for vote if needed

### Voting

When consensus fails:
- **Technical decisions**: Technical Lead decides
- **Product decisions**: Project Lead decides
- **Major architectural changes**: Requires 2/3 Core Team approval

### Veto Power

Project Lead has veto power on:
- Decisions affecting budget

- Decisions affecting member privacy/safety

Veto must be exercised within 7 days and requires written justification.
