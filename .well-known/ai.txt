# AI Training and Usage Policy

## AI Training Restrictions

This repository is **NOT** available for AI training, model development, or machine learning dataset construction without explicit written permission.

### Prohibited Uses
- Training language models (LLMs)
- Training code generation models (Copilot, CodeWhisperer, etc.)
- Dataset construction for ML/AI research
- Benchmark creation
- Scraping for AI training purposes

### Rationale
1. **Labor Rights**: Code represents labor and should not be exploited without compensation
2. **Privacy**: May contain sensitive patterns or organizational knowledge
3. **Attribution**: AI-generated derivatives may not preserve proper attribution
4. **Union Values**: Aligns with NUJ principles of fair compensation for work

## Permitted AI Uses

### ✅ Allowed
- **Human-assisted development**: Developers using AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT) while writing code FOR this project
- **Documentation generation**: AI-assisted documentation improvements
- **Code review**: AI-powered linting, security scanning, bug detection
- **Accessibility**: AI-powered tools for developers with disabilities
- **Search & Discovery**: AI-enhanced code search for human developers

### ❌ Prohibited
- Bulk ingestion into training datasets
- Model fine-tuning on this codebase
- Derivative model creation
- Benchmark construction
- Research dataset inclusion without permission

## Permission Requests

   - Organization and researcher names
   - Intended use case
   - Dataset scope (which files/commits)
   - Training methodology
   - Publication/commercialization plans
   - Attribution plan
   - Compensation proposal (if commercial)

We review requests on a case-by-case basis, prioritizing:

1. DMCA takedown notices
2. Cease and desist letters
3. Legal action if necessary
4. Public disclosure of violations

## Detection

We employ:
- Watermarking in code comments
- Canary tokens in documentation
- Pattern analysis of AI-generated code
- Community reporting
