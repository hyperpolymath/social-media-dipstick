# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Supporting union values and worker solidarity
- Recognizing and crediting others' contributions
- Maintaining professional conduct in all interactions

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Union-busting activities or undermining collective organizing
- Exploiting contributors' labor without fair compensation
- Plagiarism or misattribution of work
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Union Values

This project operates under **NUJ (National Union of Journalists)** principles:

- **Collective action**: We support unionization and worker organizing
- **Fair compensation**: Contributors' labor should be recognized and valued
- **Worker protection**: Safety (emotional, physical, digital) is paramount
- **Solidarity**: We stand with workers across all industries
- **Democratic governance**: Major decisions involve community input

## Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

We operate a graduated trust model:

### Perimeter 1: Core (Restricted)
- 2-3 maintainers with full repository access
- NUJ staff or vetted long-term contributors
- Write access to main branch
- Release management authority

### Perimeter 2: Trusted (Regulated)
- 5-10 contributors with elevated privileges
- Proven track record (3+ merged PRs)
- Review authority on pull requests
- Can trigger CI/CD pipelines

### Perimeter 3: Community (Sandbox)
- Open to all contributors
- Fork and pull request workflow
- All contributions welcome
- No repository access until trust earned

**Advancement**: Contributors move between perimeters based on sustained positive contribution, not technical skill alone.

## Emotional Safety

We recognize that **emotional temperature** affects productivity:

- **Experiment safety**: Try things without fear of ridicule
- **Reversibility**: Most changes can be undone (documented in git)
- **Mistake normalization**: Bugs are learning opportunities
- **Anxiety reduction**: No "dumb questions" policy
- **Burnout prevention**: Respect work-life boundaries
- **Constructive feedback**: Critique code, not people

### Red Flags

If you experience any of these, please report:
- Persistent hostility or negativity
- Gatekeeping ("you're not a real developer")
- Sealioning (repeated bad-faith questions)
- Dogpiling (coordinated pile-on)
- Subtle undermining of contributions
- Exclusionary language or in-jokes

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

- Online and offline at project events

Representation includes:
